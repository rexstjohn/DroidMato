DROIDMATO

This is an example implementation of an Android RottenTomatoes API app based on the Mashery hosted API for RT.
Included is an Async unit test and object model for getting movies that are currently in theaters. At this point I just display the movie poster but the data is there to get other info. 

Anyone using this API must sign up and make correct use of Rotten Tomatoes' branding as below:

Rotten Tomatoes API: http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/
Rotten Tomatoes Branding Guidelines: http://developer.rottentomatoes.com/docs/brand_guidelines

INSTRUCTIONS

You must open GetMoviesAsyncTask and replace XXXXXX with your developer API key. Build and run in Genymotion.
